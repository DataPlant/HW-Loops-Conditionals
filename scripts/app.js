// ----- Inventory
// 2. Thom wants to do inventory on his closet.Using bracket notation, log the arrays(not the elements in the arrays) containing all of Thom's shirts, pants, and accessories.


// ----- Multiples of 3 and 5
// Yes, you might have tackled this earlier, but try it again(don't look back at your other code ðŸ‘€)
// If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

// 0. declare a variable argument and set it equal to 7.

#######

// ----- Find the Median
// -Find the median number in the following nums array, then console.log that number.
//hint this will likely involve breaking down the problem into a few steps
//hint: Click "Details" below(don't read this unless you've been stuck for a while)
//   Details: if you check the length of the array / 2, you might get not get a whole number.In which case, look into`Math.floor( // something )`
